# AndroidRetrofit2RxJava
First Approch<br>
In this project i have shown how to working with Retrofit 2 and RxJava to fetch API and display data.
#### Updates: Here I have used older dependencies so we have to include compilerOptions for Java8
```
compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
```
I am also using <b> Fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping </b> provided by <b>JSONPlaceholder</b>. You will find more details
from this <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">link</a>.
